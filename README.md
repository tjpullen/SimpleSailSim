## Welcome to SimpleSailSim

This project is to design a very simple 2D sailing simulator aimed at teaching the basic principles of sailing to beginners.

### Prototypes

A simple prototype demonstrating boat movement and controls: (sail.html)[sail.html]

A demonstration of boat controls on a stationary boat: [sail_demo.html](sail_demo.html)

### Game 1: Fixy sailing

[sail_fixy.html](sail_fixy.html)

To learn how the sail propels the boat. Point the boat and set the sail then watch where it goes.

*Note - This is a simple setup where the boat doesn't slip sideways and sail angle is controlled directly rather than through a sheet.*

## Game 2: 1 target games

Sail the boat to hit a target of different points of sail:

+ [sail_1_target_2.html](sail_1_target_2.html)
+ [sail_1_target_3.html](sail_1_target_3.html)
+ [sail_1_target_4.html](sail_1_target_4.html)
+ [sail_1_target_5.html](sail_1_target_5.html)

*Note - This is a more realistic setup where the boat can slip sideways and sail is controlled through a sheet.*

## Game 3: 3 target game

[sail_3_targets.html](sail_3_targets.html)

Sail the boat to hit the targets as quickly as possible.

## Game 4: 8 target game

[sail_8_targets.html](sail_8_targets.html)

As above but with more targets.
