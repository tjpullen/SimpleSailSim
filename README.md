## Welcome to SimpleSailSim

This project is to design a very simple 2D sailing simulator aimed at teaching the basic principles of sailing to beginners.

### Prototypes

A simple prototype demonstrating boat movement and controls: [sail.html](sail.html)

A demonstration of boat controls on a stationary boat: [sail_demo.html](sail_demo.html)

### Game 1: Fixy sailing

[sail_fixy.html](sail_fixy.html)

To learn how the sail propels the boat. Choose which target to aim for, point the boat and set the sail then release the boat and watch where it goes. You can't steer or adjust the sail once it's released to get people to think more carefully about how the sail works. You can't reach all targets so people discover the no-go zone. Encourage people to try multiple times to find out which sail setting is fastest. Reload the page to reset the game.

*Note - This is a simple setup where the boat doesn't slip sideways and sail angle is controlled directly rather than through a sheet.*

### Game 2: 1 target games

Sail the boat to hit a target on different points of sail:

+ [sail_1_target_2.html](sail_1_target_2.html)
+ [sail_1_target_3.html](sail_1_target_3.html)
+ [sail_1_target_4.html](sail_1_target_4.html)
+ [sail_1_target_5.html](sail_1_target_5.html)

Reload the page to reset the game.

*Note - This is a more realistic setup where the boat can slip sideways and sail is controlled through a sheet.*

### Game 3: 3 target game

[sail_3_targets.html](sail_3_targets.html)

Sail the boat to hit the targets as quickly as possible. Reload the page to reset the game.

### Game 4: 8 target game

[sail_8_targets.html](sail_8_targets.html)

As above but with more targets.

### Game 5: 3 buoy practice

[sail_3_buoys.html](sail_3_buoys.html)
[sail_3_buoys_2.html](sail_3_buoys_2.html)

This time with buoys rather than targets. Two triangular courses to practice sailing around in different orientations.

### Game 6: Triangular courses

[sail_course_1.html](sail_course_1.html)

A triangular course with timing and penalties for hitting buoys.

### Game 7: Double triangular courses

[sail_course_2.html](sail_course_2.html)

As above but with 2 laps.
